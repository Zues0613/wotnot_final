# Upstash Redis Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup for WotNot Backend

### 1. Create Upstash Account
1. Go to [https://console.upstash.com/](https://console.upstash.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email

### 2. Create Redis Database
1. Click "Create Database"
2. Choose "Global" region (closest to your users)
3. Select "Free" tier (10,000 requests/day)
4. Give it a name like "wotnot-redis"
5. Click "Create"

### 3. Get Redis Credentials
1. Click on your database
2. Go to "Details" tab
3. You'll see several connection options. For Dramatiq, you need:
   - **REST URL** (e.g., `https://fast-bluejay-19956.upstash.io`) - for REST API
   - **REST Token** (a long alphanumeric string) - for REST API
   
   **Note:** The code automatically constructs the Redis protocol URL from these REST credentials for Dramatiq to use.
   
   **Alternative:** If you prefer, Upstash also provides a direct **Redis URL** (starts with `redis://`) that you can use with the `REDIS_URL` environment variable instead.

### 4. Add to Environment Variables
Add both environment variables to your backend:

**For local development (.env file):**
```env
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL="https://fast-bluejay-19956.upstash.io"
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="your-token-here"
```

**For production (Render/Heroku/etc.):**
1. Go to your deployment platform dashboard
2. Select your web service
3. Go to "Environment" tab
4. Add these two environment variables:
   - **Key**: `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`
   - **Value**: Your Upstash REST URL
   - **Key**: `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`
   - **Value**: Your Upstash REST Token
5. Click "Save Changes"

### 5. Deploy
1. Your app will automatically redeploy
2. Check logs to see "✅ Redis URL found" message
3. Background tasks will now work with Upstash Redis
